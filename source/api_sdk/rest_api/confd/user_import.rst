CSV User Import
***************

Users and common related resources can be imported onto a XiVO server by sending a CSV file with a
predefined set of fields.

This page only documents additional notes useful for API users. Consult the `API documentation
<http://api.xivo.io>`_ for more details.

To consult general info about import CSV (CSV format...), see the `User Import and Export <http://documentation.xivo.io/en/xivo-16.03/administration/users/csv_import.html>`_ page.


Uploading files
===============

Files may be uploaded as usual through the web interface, or from a console by using HTTP utilities
and the REST API. When uploading through the API, the header `Content-Type: text/csv charset=utf-8`
must be set and the CSV data must be sent in the body of the request. A file may be uploaded using
`curl` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

	curl -k -H "Content-Type: text/csv; charset=utf-8" -u username:password --data-binary "@file.csv" https://xivo:9486/1.1/users/import

The response can be reindented in a more readable format by piping the output through `python -m
json.tool` in the following way:

.. code-block:: bash

	curl (...) | python -m json.tool
